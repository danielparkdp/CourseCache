CourseCache is an online website that helps students find new, interesting courses based on their interests/willingness to learn something new. It currently supports courses for Brown University and Western University. CourseCache is designed to easily add new universities to the site!

CourseFinder will take in key words or "interests", then search the university's courses websites using web scraping and databasing to find related courses that might interest the user. The aim is to find new, interesting courses that might not be very well known as a concentration requirement.

There are also options to explore new courses outside of your concentrations such as "I'm feeling lucky".

The development was done using Node.js/Express back-end with HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end.

Now live at www.course-cache.com!
